/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8ï¿½8 grid, using newline
characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
of the given width and height
*/

var size = 8;
var chessboard = "";

//line loop
for (y = 0; y < size; y++) {
  //char loop
  for (x = 0; x < size; x++) {
    if ((x + y) % 2 === 0) {
      chessboard += " ";
    } else {
      chessboard += "#";
    }
  }
  chessboard += "\n";
}

console.log(chessboard);
